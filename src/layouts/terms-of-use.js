    <h5>Utterzone Terms and Conditions</h5>
    <p>
      You are agreeing to these terms and conditions when you use our service.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Platform is very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product
      requirements (including age requirements) may apply. Additional terms will
      be available with the relevant Platform, and those additional terms become
      part of your agreement with us if you use those Platform.
    </p>
    <h6>Using our Platform</h6>
    <p>
      You must follow any policies made available to you within the Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don’t misuse our Platform. For example, don’t interfere with our Platform
      or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the
      instructions that we provide. You may use our Platform only as permitted
      by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and
      regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Platform to you if you
      do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating
      suspected misconduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using our Platform does not give you ownership of any intellectual
      property rights in our Platform or the content you access. You may not use
      content from our Platform unless you obtain permission from its owner or
      are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to
      use any branding or logos used in our Platform. Don’t remove, obscure, or
      alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Platform display some content that is not Utterzone’s. This content is
      the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may
      review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our
      policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we
      reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not
      necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      In connection with your use of the Platform, we may send you service
      announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt
      out of some of those communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of our Platform are available on mobile devices. Do not use such
      Platform in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic
      or safety laws.
    </p>
    <h6>Your Utterzone Account</h6>
    <p>
      You may need an Utterzone Account in order to use some of our Platform.
      You may create your own Utterzone Account, or your Utterzone Account may
      be assigned to you by an administrator, such as your employer or
      educational institution. If you are using a Utterzone Account assigned to
      you by an administrator, different or additional terms may apply and your
      administrator may be able to access or disable your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      To protect your Utterzone Account, keep your password confidential. You
      are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Utterzone
      Account. Try not to reuse your Utterzone Account password on third-party
      applications. If you learn of any unauthorized use of your password or
      Utterzone Account please contact support.
    </p>
    <h6>Privacy and Copyright Protection</h6>
    <p>
      <a href="/privacy-policy" target="_blank">
        Utterzone’s privacy policies
      </a>{" "}
      explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you
      use our Platform. By using our Platform, you agree that Utterzone can use
      such data in accordance with our privacy policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate
      accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S.
      Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
    </p>
    <h6>Your Content in our Platform</h6>
    <p>
      Some of our Platform allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive
      content. The content you store on our servers will transfer ownership to
      Utterzone. Therefore if you decide not to use our services and/or cancel
      your account, it will be up to Utterzone to keep or delete the content.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our
      Platform, you give Utterzone (and those we work with) a worldwide license
      to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as
      those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we make so
      that your content works better with our Platform), communicate, publish,
      publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. The rights
      you grant in this license are for the limited purpose of operating,
      promoting, and improving our Platform, and to develop new ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide
      you personally relevant product features, such as customized search
      results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This
      analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a Utterzone Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile
      photo, and actions you take on Utterzone or on third-party applications
      connected to your Utterzone Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and
      messages you post) in our Platform, including displaying in ads and other
      commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to limit sharing
      or visibility settings in your Utterzone Account. For example, you can
      choose your settings so your name and photo do not appear in an ad.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Platform, we may use your
      feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.
    </p>
    <h6>About Software in our Platform</h6>
    <p>
      When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software
      may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature is
      available. Some Platform may let you adjust your automatic update
      settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Utterzone gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable
      and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Utterzone
      as part of the Platform. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling
      you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Platform as provided by Utterzone,
      in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify,
      distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Platform or included software,
      nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that
      software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written
      permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our
      Platform may be offered under an open source license that we will make
      available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that
      expressly override some of these terms.
    </p>
    <h6>Modifying and Terminating our Platform</h6>
    <p>
      We are constantly changing and improving our Platform. We may add or
      remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can stop using our Platform at any time, although we’ll be sorry to
      see you go. Utterzone may also stop providing Platform to you, or add or
      create new limits to our Platform at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data
      is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we
      will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information
      out of that Service.
    </p>
    <h6>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h6>
    <p>
      We provide our Platform using a commercially reasonable level of skill and
      care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain
      things that we don’t promise about our Platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms,
      neither Utterzone nor its suppliers or distributors make any specific
      promises about the Platform. For example, we don’t make any commitments
      about the content within the Platform, the specific functions of the
      Platform, or their reliability, availability, or ability to meet your
      needs. We provide the Platform “as is”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied
      warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
      non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all
      warranties.
    </p>
    <h6> Liability for our Platform</h6>
    <p>
      When permitted by law, Utterzone, and Utterzone’s suppliers and
      distributors, will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data,
      financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or
      punitive damages.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the extent permitted by law, the total liability of Utterzone, and its
      suppliers and distributors, for any claims under these terms, including
      for any implied warranties, is limited to the amount you paid us to use
      the Platform (or, if we choose, to supplying you the Platform again).
    </p>
    <p>
      In all cases, Utterzone, and its suppliers and distributors, will not be
      liable for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recognize that in some countries, you might have legal rights as a
      consumer. If you are using the Platform for a personal purpose, then
      nothing in these terms or any additional terms limits any consumer legal
      rights which may not be waived by contract.
    </p>
    <h6>Business uses of our Platform</h6>
    <p>
      If you are using our Platform on behalf of a business, that business
      accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Utterzone and its
      affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim, suit or action
      arising from or related to the use of the Platform or violation of these
      terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses,
      damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.
    </p>
    <h6>About these Terms</h6>
    <p>
      We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service
      to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Platform.
      You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications
      to these terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional
      terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and
      will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted.
      However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made
      for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to
      the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that
      Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the
      additional terms will control for that conflict.
    </p>
    <p>These terms control the relationship</p>
    between Utterzone and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary
    rights.
    <p>
      If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right
      away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have
      (such as taking action in the future).
    </p>
    <p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable,</p>
    this will not affect any other terms.
    <p>
      {" "}
      The courts in some countries will not apply our state law to some types of
      disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where our state
      law is excluded from applying, your country’s laws will apply to such
      disputes related to these terms. Otherwise, you agree that the laws of the
      state where Utterzone presides in will apply to any disputes arising out
      of or relating to these terms or the Platform. Similarly, if the courts in
      your country will not permit you to consent to the jurisdiction and venue
      of the courts in the state where Utterzone presides in then your local
      jurisdiction and venue will apply to such disputes related to these terms.
      Otherwise, all claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the
      services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts
      where Utterzone presides in and you and Utterzone consent to personal
      jurisdiction in those courts.
